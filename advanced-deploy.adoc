## Zero-downtime Deployments in Production

In this lab you will learn how to roll out new releases to production without impacting the users of your application.

### Background
*Zero downtime* means that even during a deployment process, your service is responsive the whole time. Typical services in today's world are some HTTP services, so in practice this means that no requests are dropped at any point during the deployment process. During a typical deployment process we usually change our software to a newer version on the servers.

OpenShift provides an easy way to do *Blue/Green deployments*. Blue/Green deployments is a technique for **releasing your application** in a **predictable** manner with a goal of **reducing any downtime associated with a release**. It's a quick way to prime your app before releasing, and also quickly roll back if you find issues.

Simply, you have two identical environments (infrastructure) with the “green” environment hosting the current production apps. and the "blue environment" ready to accept new versions of the application. In this environment you deploy the new version of the application, run smoke tests, and any other tests (including those to exercise/prime the OS, cache, CPU, etc). When things look good, you change the loadbalancer/reverse proxy/router to point to the blue environment.

You monitor for any failures or exceptions because of the release. If everything looks good, you can eventually shut down the green environment and use it to stage any new releases. If not, you can quickly rollback to the green environment by pointing the loadbalancer back.

*Canary releases* are a way of sending out a new version of your application into production that plays the role of a “canary” to get an idea of how it will perform (integrate with other apps, CPU, memory, disk usage, etc). It’s another release strategy that can mitigate the fact that regardless of the immense level of testing you do in lower environments you will still have some bugs in production. Canary releases let you test the waters before pulling the trigger on a full release. 

Similarly to a Blue/Green deployment, you'll have two versions of your application deployed, but in this scenario, both will accept load indistincly. The amount of load you send to the Canary initially is very low, but one can increase it with time to gain confidence. Eventually, the canary side will assume the 100% of the load, and the old version could be safely retired, or kept in place for a quick rollback in case required.

A canary release is used to get faster feedback without impacting all of the users of the application so you can fail the deployment faster, or proceed cautiously.

We are going to release a new version of our application using a Canary release.

You can run the **catalog-release** pipeline once more, in order to simulate as if you have changes 
in the Catalog service and need to release a new version.

### Configure Canary Release Pipeline for Catalog Service

Let's create our Pipeline that will drive the canary release process.

Change to the `cd-infra` repository working copy on your workstation:

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
----
cd cd-infra
----


Create the Jenkinsfile for canary release of Catalog to the PROD environment:

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
----
cat <<'EOF' > Jenkinsfile.catalog-prod
def namespace, releaseTag, prodCluster, prodToken, activeSvc, canarySvc

            withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: "${namespace}-prod-credentials", usernameVariable: "PROD_USER", passwordVariable: "PROD_TOKEN")]) {
              prodToken = env.PROD_TOKEN
            }
            def tags = openshift.selector("istag").objects().collect { it.metadata.name }.findAll { it.startsWith 'catalog:' }.collect { it.replaceAll(/catalog:(.*)/, "\$1") }.sort()
            timeout(5) {
              releaseTag = input(

                ]
              )

          }
        }
      }
    }
    stage('Deploy Canary 10%') {
      steps {

Add the Jenkinsfile to `cd-infra` git repository:

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
----
git add Jenkinsfile.catalog-prod
git commit -m "catalog deploy prod pipeline added"
git push origin master
----

You should now see your `cd-infra` repository with all the pipelines we have created.

image::devops-zerodowntime-gogs-pipelines.png[Pipelines in Gogs]

Now, let's create a new Pipeline build in OpenShift that will use this Jenkins file.

Like before, on you `cicd{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}` project, click on *Add to project -> Import YAML/JSON* menu and enter the following definition:

CAUTION: Replace `GUID` with the guid provided to you.

[source,shell,role=copypaste]

          value: "prod{{ PROJECT_SUFFIX }}"
      jenkinsfilePath: Jenkinsfile.catalog-prod
    type: JenkinsPipeline
----

You should now see the pipeline being executed and the canary release rolling out.

image::devops-canary-created.png[Catalog Canary Release]

As the pipeline progresses, it will ask you which version of the Catalog service you want to promote to production.

image::devops-canary-input.png[Canary Release - Pick Version]

Pick a version and click on **Deploy**. 

Note that rolling back versions work the exact same way and you can pick any version to roll forward to or roll back 
to in production. You of course need to be mindful of you data and how you deal with data versions across your application 
versions.

The new Catalog version gets deployed in production in a new pod and 10% of traffic is sent to the new version to 
test it with production traffic for a subset of users.

image::devops-canary-50.png[Canary Release - 10% Traffic]

Take a look at the OpenShift Web Console in the production environment. You can see that there are two versions of the 
Catalog service deployed with the new version receiving 10% of the traffic.

image::devops-canary-10-deployed.png[Canary Release - 10% Traffic]

When ready, click on **Input Required** in the pipeline and then **Approve** to increase the amount of traffic on the 
new version. The pipeline progresses and now the new version receives 50% of the traffic.

image::devops-canary-50-deployed.png[Canary Release - 50% Traffic]

The pipeline pauses again for the final rollout to put 100% of traffic on the new version and remove the old version of 
the Catalog service.

image::devops-canary-100.png[Canary Release - 10% Traffic]

Click on **Input Required** in the pipeline again and then **Approve** the final rollout.

When the pipeline is complete, take a look at the production environment. You will notice that the old version of the 
Catalog service is removed and all traffic is sent to the new version.
