## Running the CI/CD Pipeline on Every Change

In this lab you will learn about webhooks and how to automatically run the changes 
through the pipeline everytime there is a change in the application source repository.

### Background

Manually starting the CI/CD pipeline does not really scale when there are more 
than a single developer working with the code repository. Continuous Delivery needs to 
ensure that every change (code or configuration) to the application is releasable and 
requires every change to go through the pipeline and verify if it can be release into production.

Since manually click on *Start Pipeline* every time someone commits code or configuration 
to the Git repository is not possible across an entire development team, you can use Git 
https://developer.github.com/webhooks/[Webhooks mechanism] to trigger the pipeline (and any other builds in OpenShift) automatically 
every time there is a change in the Cart service Git repository.

### Adding a Webhook

In the *CI/CD* project, click on *Builds -> Pipelines* on the left sidebar menu 
and then on *catalog-build*. You can see the history of pipeline runs and how 
long the took to run. Click on *Configuration* tab where you can see the pipeline 
configuration such as which Git repository it uses to pull the Jenkinsfile, etc. 
Copy the *Generic Webhook URL* to the clipboard by clicking on the copy icon next to the 
URL. This is the webhook URL that the Git repository should invoke on every change 
in order to trigger the pipeline.

Go to Git server by pointing your browser at Git server web url and login using your credentials:

CAUTION: Replace `GUID` with the guid provided to you.

* Git Server Web:  [blue]`\http://{{GIT_HOSTNAME}}`
* Username: `{{GIT_USER}}`
* Password: `{{GIT_PASSWORD}}`

The source code for the Catalog service is stored in the *catlaog-spring-boot* repository and you 
want the pipeline to run for every change that takes place on this git repository. Click 
on *catlaog-spring-boot* repository under *My Repositories* to go to the repository 
overview. Click on *Settings* and then *Webhooks*. Currently no webhooks are defined 
on _cart-service_ repository. Click on *Add Webhook* and choose *Gogs*. Paste 
the pipeline webhook URL you copied in previous steps into the *Payload URL* text 
field and click on *Add Webhook*.

Now for every push to the *catalog-spring-boot* git repository, the git server would make a REST call 
to OpenShift APIs at the given URL to trigger the pipeline. You can verify that the 
webhook works correctly by clicking on the webhook you just created from the list 
of webhooks and then on the *Test Delivery* button.

You should see a new Pipeline build being run.
