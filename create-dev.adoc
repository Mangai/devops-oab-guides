## Create DEV Deployment Environment

In this lab you will get familiar with OpenShift Web Console and OpenShift CLI and gain some experience 
interacting with an OpenShift cluster. You will also learn about deployment environments in 
software delivery lifecycle and deploy the application into these deployment environments.

#### OpenShift CLI

The first thing we want to do to ensure that the `oc` command line tools was installed and successfully 
added to your path. In order to login, you can use the `oc` command and then specify the server that you want to authenticate to. Issue the following command:

[source,shell]
----
$ oc login {{OPENSHIFT_URL}}
----

Enter *Y* to use a potentially insecure connection. The reason you received this message is because 
we are using a self-signed certificate for this workshop, but we did not provide you with the CA 
certificate that was generated by OpenShift. In a real-world scenario, either OpenShift 
certificate would be signed by a standard CA (eg: Thawte, Verisign, StartSSL, etc.) or signed by a 
corporate-standard CA that you already have installed on your system.

Once you issue the `oc login` command, you will be prompted for the username and password 
combination for your user account. Replace XX with the username given to you by the instructor:

CAUTION: Replace `{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}` with the number provided to you by the instructor.

* Username: `{{OPENSHIFT_USER}}`
* Password: `{{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}}`

Projects are a top level concept to help you organize your deployments. An OpenShift 
project allows a community of users (or a user) to organize and manage their content in 
isolation from other communities. Each project has its own resources, policies 
(who can or cannot perform actions), and constraints (quotas and limits on resources, etc). 

Projects act as a "wrapper" around all the application services and endpoints you 
(or your teams) are using for your work. You can see the list of projects 
you have access to using the following command:

[source,shell]
----
$ oc get projects
----

There a few projects created for you in order to use during the following labs. To simplify 
using OpenShift CLI, you can specify a project as the active project which will be used 
as the default project when running OpenShift CLI commands. 

Specify the DEV project as the active project:

[source,shell]
----
$ oc project dev{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}
----

#### OpenShift Web Console

OpenShift ships with a web-based console that will allow users to perform various tasks via a browser. To 
get a feel for how the web console works, open your browser and go to the following URL: {{OPENSHIFT_URL}}

Since the security certificates used for securing your OpenShift cluster are self-generated and 
self-signed, your browser will not trust them by default and will show a security warning similar to the following:

image::devops-explore-cert-warning-firefox.png[Firebox Untrusted Certificate]

In Chrome browser, click on *ADVANCED* and then *Proceed to ... (unsafe)* to trust the 
certificates. In Firefox browser, click on *Advanced* button, then *Add Exception...* and then 
confirm trusting the certificate by click on *Confirm Security Exception*.

The first screen you will see is the authentication screen. Enter in the following credentials:

CAUTION: Replace `{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}` with the number provided to you by the instructor.

* Username: `{{OPENSHIFT_USER}}`
* Password: `{{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}}`

After you have authenticated to the web console, you will be presented with a list of 
projects that your user has permission to work with.

#### Deployment Environments

Download source code for the CoolStore application from GitHub:

[source,shell]
----
$ wget https://github.com/openshift-labs/devops-oab-labs/archive/master.tar.gz
$ tar xvfz master.tar.gz
$ mv devops-oab-labs-master/* .
$ rm -rf devops-oab-labs-master
----


Register an account in Gogs: http://{{GIT_HOSTNAME}}

* Username: `{{GIT_USER}}`
* Email: `{{GIT_USER}}@gogs.com`
* Password: `{{GIT_PASSWORD}}`

Create a Git repository for the Catalog service.

Import the Catalog service source code into the Git repository on Gogs:

[source,shell]
----
$ cd catalog-spring-boot
$ git config --global user.name "rhdeveloper"
$ git config --global user.email "rhdeveloper@me.com"
$ git init
$ git add . --all
$ git commit -m "initial add"
$ git remote add origin http://{{GIT_USER}}:{{GIT_PASSWORD}}@{{GIT_HOSTNAME}}/{{GIT_USER}}/catalog-spring-boot.git
$ git push -u origin master
----


Create a Git repository for the Web UI.

Import the Web UI source code into the Git repository on Gogs:

[source,shell]
----
$ cd ../web-nodejs
$ git init
$ git add . --all
$ git commit -m "initial add"
$ git remote add origin http://{{GIT_USER}}:{{GIT_PASSWORD}}@{{GIT_HOSTNAME}}/{{GIT_USER}}/web-nodejs.git
$ git push -u origin master
----


The container images built for Catalog and Web UI will be stored in the `cicd{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}` project and 
deployed from there across various environments. 

Create the image streams for Catalog and Web UI (note the `-n` flag):

[source,shell]
----
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-labs/devops-oab-labs/master/openshift/catalog-is.yaml -n cicd{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}
$ oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-labs/devops-oab-labs/master/openshift/web-is.yaml -n cicd{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}
----

Deploy the Catalog service into the DEV environment:

[source,shell]
----
$ oc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-labs/devops-oab-labs/master/openshift/catalog-template.yaml \
      --param=GIT_URI=http://{{GIT_HOSTNAME}}/{{GIT_USER}}/catalog-spring-boot.git \
      --param=MAVEN_MIRROR_URL={{NEXUS_URL}} \
      --param=IMAGE_NAMESPACE=cicd{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}
----

Deploy the Web UI service into the DEV environment:

[source,shell]
----
$ oc new-app -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-labs/devops-oab-labs/master/openshift/web-template.yaml \
      --param=GIT_URI=http://{{GIT_HOSTNAME}}/{{GIT_USER}}/web-nodejs.git \
      --param=IMAGE_NAMESPACE=cicd{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}} 
----

Point your browser to the Web UI route url
