## Release Catalog Service to STAGE Environment

In previous labs, you built and deployed the Coolstore applications with the Catalog and Web containers 
into the *Coolstore DEV* project. The development phase of application generally involves many iterations 
and builds until we ready with a chunk of functionality that can be deployed into production.

In this lab, you will build the next step in the application lifecycle by releasing the application into 
the staging environment for further tests to make sure the release is eligible for production deployments.

### Define the Catalog Release Process

The first step for making a release is to create a pipeline that releases the Catalog service code by 
creating appropriate tags in the git repository so that the source code in the release can easily be traced back, 
as well as creating a binary release of the Catalog service in form of a jar file which will be used across 
all environments and deployments.

In order to create a release pipeline, first go to the `cd-infra` directory:

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
----
cd cd-infra
----

And then create a Jenkinsfile with the following content:

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
----
cat <<'EOF' > Jenkinsfile.release
def releaseTag

pipeline {
  agent {
      label 'maven'
  }
  stages {
    stage('Prepare') {
      steps {
        git url: 'http://{{GIT_HOSTNAME}}/{{GIT_USER}}/catalog-spring-boot.git'
        sh "git config --local user.email 'jenkins@cicd.com'"
        sh "git config --local user.name 'jenkins'"
        
        script {
          releaseTag = readMavenPom().getVersion().replace("-SNAPSHOT", "")
        }
      }
    }
    stage('Release Code') {
      environment {
        SCM_GIT_URL = sh(returnStdout: true, script: 'git config remote.origin.url').trim()
      }
      steps {
        script {
          openshift.withCluster() {
            withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: "${openshift.project()}-gogs-credentials", usernameVariable: "GOGS_USERNAME", passwordVariable: "GOGS_PASSWORD")]) {
              sh "mvn --batch-mode release:clean release:prepare release:perform -s .settings.xml"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
    stage('Release Image') {
      steps {
        script {
          openshift.withCluster() {
            echo "Releasing catalog image version ${releaseTag}"
            openshift.tag("${openshift.project()}/catalog:latest", "${openshift.project()}/catalog:${releaseTag}")
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF
----

The above pipeline performs the following steps:

* Checks out the source code of the Catalog service form the git repository
* Builds the Catalog service jar archive 
* Creates a git release in the Catalog git repository using the version number in the `pom.xml`
* Stores the Catalog service jar archive for the release in Nexus Maven Repository using the version number in the `pom.xml`
* Increases the Catalog service version in `pom.xml` and sets it to `SNAPSHOT`. You can learn more about Maven snapshot handling here.
* Tags the Catalog container images with the release version using the version number in the `pom.xml`

The container image that is tagged in the release process will be used across all environments for deployments 
to guarantee that all tests and verifications are performed on the exact same version. Build once, run anywhere! 

Store the `Jenkinsfile.release` pipeline in the `cd-infra` git repository so that you can control the 
history of changes on the pipeline the same way that you manage the source code versions:

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
----
git add Jenkinsfile.release
git commit -m "release pipeline added"
git push origin master
----


### Automate Releases with Pipelines

As mentioned above, the release process creates a git release in the git repository and tags the source code with 
the release version. In order for Jenkins to do that, it has to have access to the git credentials with suitable 
permissions to create tags and release in the repository. Although usually a separeate git account is created for 
Jenkins, you can use your own credentials in this lab. 

But how can you tell Jenkins to use your git credentials without exposing your password and storing it in the git 
repository? 

The answer is simple, {{OPENSHIFT_DOCS_BASE}}/dev_guide/secrets.html[OpenShift Secrets]! Secrets in OpenShift enable 
storing encrypted sensitive data like credentials without exposing the data in the git repository or even on disk or during 
transmit over the network for that matter. The Jenkins instance on OpenShift uses a series of plugins to automatically 
create Jenkins Credentials based on the secrets defined by the user which are then used in the pipeline for various 
purposes such as create releases in the git repository. 

Make sure you're still on the `cicd{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}` project.

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
----
oc project cicd{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}
----

Create a secret to hold your git credentials:

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
----
oc create secret generic gogs-credentials --from-literal=username={{GIT_USER}} --from-literal=password={{GIT_PASSWORD}}
oc label secret gogs-credentials credential.sync.jenkins.openshift.io=true
----

Notice that due to security considerations, not all secrets are injected into Jenkins as Jenkins Credentials. The second 
command above, annotates the secret to tell OpenShift that this secret should be injected into Jenkins to be used 
within the pipeline.

Review the `withCredentials(...)` construct in the above pipeline to see how OpenShift secrets can be used as Jenkins 
credentials within a Jenkins.


You can now create an OpenShift pipeline that refers to the `Jenkinsfile.release` that you have stored in the git 
repository. In the *cicd{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}* project, click on *Add to Project* > *Import YAML/JSON* and paste the following 
into the field:

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
----
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
kind: BuildConfig
metadata:
  name: catalog-release
spec:
  runPolicy: Serial
  source:
    git:
      ref: master
      uri: "http://{{GIT_HOSTNAME}}/{{GIT_USER}}/cd-infra.git"
    type: Git
  strategy:
    jenkinsPipelineStrategy:
      env:
        - name: NEXUS_URL
          value: "{{NEXUS_URL}}"
        - name: STAGE_PROJECT
          value: "stage{{PROJECT_SUFFIX}}"
      jenkinsfilePath: Jenkinsfile.release
    type: JenkinsPipeline
  triggers:
    - github:
        secret: CqPGlXcKJXXqKxW4Ye6z
      type: GitHub
    - generic:
        secret: 4LXwMdx9vhQY4WXbLcFR
      type: Generic
    - type: ConfigChange
----

Click on *Create* to create the pipeline. Notice the `git.uri` and `jenkinsfilePath` fields in the above 
YAML which specify the git repository where the Jenkinsfile is stored and the exact name of the Jenkinsfile.


Go to *Builds* > *Pipelines* to see the pipeline execution in progress. 

After the pipeline is completed successfully (all green, yaay!), go the git repository in your browser to 
review the git release that is created:

Git server web: http://{{GIT_HOSTNAME}}/{{GIT_USER}}/catalog-spring-boot/releases[http://{{GIT_HOSTNAME}}/{{GIT_USER}}/catalog-spring-boot]

image::devops-stage-gogs-release.png[Gogs release]


Point your browser to the Nexus Maven Repository to review the binary release of the Catalog service in form 
of a jar file:

Nexus Maven Repository: http://{{NEXUS_EXTERNAL_URL}}/#browse/browse:maven-all-public:com%2Fredhat%2Fcloudnative%2Fcatalog[http://{{NEXUS_EXTERNAL_URL}}/#browse/browse:maven-all-public:com%2Fredhat%2Fcloudnative%2Fcatalog]

### Deploy Releases into Staging Environment

After creating the application release, it should then be deployed into the staging environment so that more 
thorough tests (system integration, performance, user-acceptance, etc) can be performed before deciding if 
a release can be deployed into production.

The *CoolStore STAGE* project is already created for you and is the staging environment for the CoolStore 
application.

Extend the release pipeline in order to not only create a release but also create a container image from the 
binary release catalog and deploy the container image in the staging environment all at once.

If you are comfortable with `vi` text editor, we envy you. Use that and good luck! (don't 
forget to run `git commit` and `git push`)

If not, use the git server web for editing the `Jenkinsfile.release`:
http://{{GIT_HOSTNAME}}/{{GIT_USER}}/cd-infra/src/master/Jenkinsfile.release

Click on the pencil icon to edit `Jenkinsfile.release` and add the following `stages` at the 
end of the release pipeline and click on *Commit* button.

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
----
pipeline {
    ...

    // START-COPY

    stage('Tear-down STAGE') {
      steps {
        script {
          openshift.withCluster() {
            openshift.withProject(env.STAGE_PROJECT) {
              openshift.raw('delete all,cm,pvc --all')
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }    
    stage('Deploy STAGE') {
      steps {
        script {
          openshift.withCluster() {
            def imageNamespace = openshift.project()
            openshift.withProject(env.STAGE_PROJECT) {
              def template = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/{{ LABS_GITHUB_ACCOUNT }}/devops-oab-labs/master/openshift/coolstore-template.yaml'
              openshift.apply(
                openshift.process("-f", template, "-p", "CATALOG_IMAGE_VERSION=${releaseTag}", "-p", "IMAGE_NAMESPACE=${imageNamespace}")
              )
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

    // END-COPY

  }
}

The `Tear-down STAGE` and `Deploy STAGE` stages in the pipeline remove the existing deployments in 
the staging environment and then deploy the new version from scratch in that order. This practices is employed in 
order to build confidence in the process for building new environments whenever needed without 
the common repeatability concerns that often surrounds deployments environment. Need more 
test and staging environments? They are one click away!

Go to *Builds* > *Pipelines* and start the pipeline again by clicking on the *Start the Pipeline*. 


image::devops-stage-released.png[Stage released]

As the pipeline execution progresses, you will see the latest release gets deployed in the *CoolStore STAGE* 
environment.
