## Provisioning External Databases

In previous lab we created an pipeline to deploy our Catalog service and Web UI to *CoolStore STAGE* project. The Catalog 
service uses a MySQL database which is deployed on in a pod running in the same project. You can click on the **Catalog** 
in the left sidebar and then on **Databases** and **MySQL** to see the MySQL images that are provided by OpenShift which 
are all deployed as containers.

Many organizations have invested in sophisticated database solutions that run on their own 
infrastructure on virtual machines or bare-metal servers and want 
to continue to use their existing database infrastructure with their containerizes applications.

In this lab you will provision an external MySQL database on DigtalOcean cloud servers and connect it to 
the Catalog service. Furthermore, you will automate this process using Ansible and Ansible Playbook Bundles (APB). 

https://www.ansible.com/[Ansible] is a radically simple IT automation system that handles configuration-management, 
application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task-execution, etc on a wide verity of infrastructure like hyporvisors, 
cloud-providers, load-balancers and more. Ansible is already being used in many organizations to automate infrastructure 
tasks.  

{{OPENSHIFT_DOCS_BASE}}/apb_devel/index.html[Ansible Playbook Bundles (APB)] is a lightweight provisioning mechanism in OpenShift 
that allows using Ansible playbooks for automation particularly tasks that need to be performed on the infrastructure outside 
OpenShift.

You will learn more APBs in the next section.


### Introduction to Ansible Playbook Bundles

An Ansible Playbook Bundle (APB) is a lightweight application definition (meta-container). They are used to define and 
deploy complex groups of applications, deployment configs, deployments, and services to an OpenShift cluster running 
the {{OPENSHIFT_DOCS_BASE}}/architecture/service_catalog/ansible_service_broker.html#arch-ansible-service-broker[OpenShift Ansible Broker (OAB)]. 
APBs offer more power and simple configuration by leveraging the power of Ansible. 

The {{OPENSHIFT_DOCS_BASE}}/architecture/service_catalog/ansible_service_broker.html#arch-ansible-service-broker[Ansible Service Broker] is 
an implementation of the https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org[Open Service Broker API] for exposing and managing applications defined by APBs.

Specification of an APB is intended to be lightweight, consisting of several named playbooks and a metadata file to capture information 
such as parameters to pass into the application.

The workflow for building an APB is consist of the following steps:

. Prepare APB skeleton
. Create APB spec file
. Create action Ansible playbooks (provision, deprovision, bind, unbind)
. Build APB image
. Deploy APB image and add to service catalog

The {{OPENSHIFT_DOCS_BASE}}/apb_devel/cli_tooling.html[apb CLI tool] helps with the above steps and you will be using 
it throughout this lab to build and deploy your APB.

The first step is to prepare your APB’s directory structure and spec file before you can build and deploy it. Create an APB project using the APB CLI:

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
```
cd ~
apb init mysql-digital-ocean-apb --bindable
```

NOTE: The `mysql-digital-ocean-apb` is an arbitrary name that we have chosen 
in this lab as the name of the APB that will provision a MySQL database on 
DigtalOcean.

The `apb init`` command creates the required skeleton directory structure and a few required files (for example, the apb.yml spec file) for the APB.

```
mysql-digital-ocean-apb/
  ├── Dockerfile
  ├── Makefile
  ├── apb.yml
  └── roles/
  │   └── bind-mysql-digital-ocean-apb/
  │   └── unbind-mysql-digital-ocean-apb/
  │   └── provision-mysql-digital-ocean-apb/
  │   └── deprovision-digital-ocean-apb/
  └── playbooks/
      └── provision.yml
      └── deprovision.yml
      └── bind.yml
      └── unbind.yml
```

Take a look at the APB spec which defines the outline of the APB and metadata like name, version and parameters such as a database name 
that you want users to enter when ordering the APB in order to customize its behavior. 

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
```
cd mysql-digital-ocean-apb
cat apb.yml
```

Run the following to replace `apb.yml` in order to add all the parameters such as database name, DigtalOcean region, 
etc as well as define database server sizes (small, medium and large):

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
```

```

An action for an APB is the command that the APB is run with and is defined by the https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org[Open Service Broker API]. The standard actions are:

* **provision:** create new resources e.g. a database
* **deprovision:** delete any resources it created during the provision
* **bind:** return credentials needed to access the resources e.g. username and password for the database
* **unbind:** remove the resource credentials

For an action, there is an Ansible playbook available in the `playbooks/` directory named the same as the action. These playbooks can do anything and 
use all roles that are available in the Ansible ecosystem. 

Most APBs will normally have a provision action to create resources and a deprovision action to destroy the resources when deleting the service.

The bind and unbind actions are used when the coordinates of one service needs to be made available to another service, 
like the database credentials in this lab. This is often the case when creating a data service and making it available to an application. 

Single actions use normal Ansible playbooks, this gives your enormous power 
to be able to automate provisioning any type of infrastructure directly from 
the service catalog in OpenShift. The Ansible ecosystem already has a long list 
of published playbooks and roles for automation of Oracle, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, VMware, and other type of 
infrastructure both on-premise and in the public clouds. Have a peek at https://galaxy.ansible.com/explore#/[Ansible Galaxy] to 
see some of the roles that the Ansible community has built and published.

The playbooks needed for creating and removing MySQL databases on DigtalOcean 
is already prepared for you (using the official 
http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/digital_ocean_module.html[DigitalOcean Ansible modules]). 
Copy the playbooks into your APB directory:

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
```
\cp -rf ~/support/mysql-digital-ocean-apb/{playbooks,roles} . 
```

NOTE: `\cp` is used to disable the linux alias so that you don't have to confirm an overwrite for every single file.

That's all. You can now build the APB image using the APB CLI tool. 

The build step is responsible for building a container image from the named playbooks for distribution. Packaging combines 
a base image containing an Ansible runtime with Ansible artifacts and any dependencies required to run the playbooks.

The result is a container image that executes the playbooks based on the chosen action (provision, deprovision, etc).

The `Dockerfile` for building the APB image is already generated for you by the 
`apb init` command. However for using the DigitalOcean Ansible modules, you need 
to add some extra dependencies into the `Dockerfile`.

Run the following to replace the `Dockerfile` with the one that includes the 
required dependencies:

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
```
cat <<'EOF' > Dockerfile
FROM openshift3/apb-base:v3.9

LABEL "com.redhat.apb.spec"=\

RUN yum-config-manager --disable rhel-7-server-htb-rpms && \
    yum install -y https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm && \
    yum -y update && \
    yum -y install python git python-pip python-requests python-setuptools python-wheel && \
    yum clean all

RUN pip install --upgrade pip --user apb --cache-dir /tmp && \
    pip install --user apb 'dopy>=0.3.7,<=0.3.7' --cache-dir /tmp

RUN chown -R apb:0 /opt/apb && \
    chmod -R g=u /opt/apb /etc/passwd

COPY playbooks /opt/apb/actions
COPY roles /opt/apb/actions/roles
RUN chmod -R g=u /opt/{ansible,apb}
USER apb
ENV ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING false

EOF
```

Build the APB::

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
```
apb build
```

It will take a little while till the APB container image is built. After it finishes, you would see something like:

[source,shell]
```
Finished writing dockerfile.
Building APB using tag: [mysql-digital-ocean-apb]
Successfully built APB image: mysql-digital-ocean-apb
```

The APB is ready know and the image is stored in your local docker daemon. In 
order to use the APB in OpenShift, you also need to add it to OpenShift service 
catalog. Admin users are in charge of managing the service catalog and 
therefore, you should log in as the admin in order to be able to publish 
your APB.

Log in to OpenShift as admin using OpenShift CLI:

* Admin Username: `{{OPENSHIFT_ADMIN_USER}}`
* Admin Password: `{{OPENSHIFT_ADMIN_PASSWORD}}`

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
```
oc login -u {{OPENSHIFT_ADMIN_USER}} -p {{OPENSHIFT_ADMIN_PASSWORD}}
```

And then publish your APB to OpenShift:

CAUTION: Replace `GUID` with the guid provided to you.

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
```
apb push --registry-route {{ OPENSHIFT_REGISTRY }}
```

You should see something like:

[source,shell]
```
...
Successfully bootstrapped Ansible Service Broker
Successfully relisted the Service Catalog
```

Ansible playbooks inside your APB need DigtalOcean API Key in order to authenticate against 
DigitalOcean and create servers. The OpenShift admin has already defined an 
{{OPENSHIFT_DOCS_BASE}}/dev_guide/secrets.html[OpenShift secret] in the platform that stores 
the DigitalOcean API Key and are automatically injected into the pods executing the APB.

Let's try your new MySQL DigitalOcean APB. 

Go to the OpenShift Web Console and inside stage environment (*CoolStore STAGE* project), and click 
on **Catalog** on the left sidebar (or just search for _DigitalOcean_ in the **Search Catalog**).

If you don't see an item called **Digital Ocean MySQL (APB)**, refresh your browser. 

Click on **DigtalOcean MySQL** to provision a MySQL database on DigitalOcean. 


If catalog item is not visible refresh Web Console or logout and log back in.

image::devops-externaldb-search-catalog.png[Search catalog for APB]

Once correct catalog item is selected you will be displayed general information about the item.

image::devops-externaldb-apb-general-info.png[General info about APB]

Service Broker API gives you possibility to have different plans in your Service Catalog items. This APB 
has three plans 512mb, 2gb and 4gb as you defined in the APB spec `apb.yml`. 

Default plan _512mb_ is already selected for you.

image::devops-externaldb-select-plan.png[Select plan]

All service catalog items accept parameters which you can use to tune your
services to be provisioned. Different plans can have different parameters, but in this 
case parameters are the same for all plans. Parameters are also defined in `apb.yml` file during 
APB creation process. 

All parameters is this APB are mandatory. You can choose in which DigtalOcean region you want 
your database to be provisioned. Default `sfo1` is close so we'll use that. 

Enter these values and then click on **Next**:

* Database service name: `externaldatabase`
* Database user password: `openshiftrocks`
* Retype Database user password: `openshiftrocks`

image::devops-externaldb-configuration.png[Configure your service]

When you provisioned Jenkins from Service Catalog you didn't create any secrets that can be bind to other 
applications in the projects. This time we need that secret so that Catalog service knows how to 
connect to this database. We will link created secrets to catalog application later. 

image::devops-externaldb-choose-bind-creds.png[Create secret for binding]

All done, next click on **Continue to the project overview**. At the and of the overview page you will 
see a **Digital Ocean MySQL (APB)** services and its state under **Provisioned Services**. Provision 
and binding will take from 5-10 minutes until the server is deployed on Digital Ocean and MySQL is 
installed on it.

image::devops-externaldb-provisioning-ongoing.png[Service provisioning]

Provisioning is executed in a pod in namespace which is created by Openshift Ansible Service Broker. This namespace 
and also pod have a random name, so we need to use labels to find correct project and pod. By default these provisioning 
and deprovisioning namesapaces are removed automatically. You can change this behaviour from Ansible 
Service Broker configuration.


You can also take a look at the Ansible logs as they getting executed. First find the project 
name where the APB is running:

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
```
oc get project -l apb-fqname=localregistry-mysql-digital-ocean-apb
oc project localregistry-mysql-digital-ocean-apb-prov-NNNNN
```

Then see the logs from the APB pod. Note that you should replace your own project and pod name 
in the following commands:

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
```
oc get pods -n localregistry-mysql-digital-ocean-apb-prov-NNNNN
oc logs -f apb-NNNNNNNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNN-NNNNNNNNN 
```

You won't need the admin user anymore, so log back in as the `{{ OPENSHIFT_USER }}` user:

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
```
oc login -u {{ OPENSHIFT_USER }}
```

You can check is everything is ready by expanding services under **Provisioned Services**

image::devops-externaldb-open-service.png[Expand service view]

When the secret containing the MySQL database credentials is created for you, you will see the **Delete** 
and **View Secret** links being visible. If those are not present, provisioning and binding is not complete 
yet. 

Select **View Secret** to display information about secret.

image::devops-externaldb-view-secret.png[View secret]

You can now add this secret to any application you have in your project so that the MySQL credentials get injected 
into the application pod as environment variables or a file. 

Select **Add to Application** to continue.

image::devops-externaldb-add-to-application.png[Add secret to application]

Select **catalog** and select **Environment variables**. Enter `APB_` as **Prefix** so that all environment variables that 
come from this secret are prefixed with `APB_`. This allows us to avoid accidentally overwriting other 
environment variables that you may already have. Click on **Save**.

image::devops-externaldb-select-application.png[Select application and give env prefix]

Now all the info (username, password, hostname, tec) needed for the Catalog service to connect to the external MySQL 
database on DigitalOcean is available in the Catalog pod. Catalog service is based on Spring Boot and we have already 
externalized its configuration into a configmap that is injected in the Catalog pod by the platform, similar to how the 
secrets are injected into the pod.

On the left sidebar click on **Resources** > **Config Maps** > **catalog**.

You can see the current Catalog configuration that uses the MySQL pod deployed within the staging environment.

image::devops-externaldb-config-before.png[Catalog Configuration]


Click on **Actions** > **Edit** to modify the configmap and use the environment variables 
that come from the APB binding (secret). Paste the following into the configmap and click on **Save**.

[source,shell,role=copypaste]
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://${APB_DB_SERVICE_NAME}:${APB_DB_SERVICE_PORT}/${APB_DB_NAME}?useSSL=false
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.username=${APB_DB_USER}
spring.datasource.password=${APB_DB_PASSWORD}
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
```

image::devops-externaldb-config-after.png[Catalog Configuration]

Note that the `APB_DB_SERVICE_NAME`, `APB_DB_USER`, `APB_DB_NAME`, `APB_DB_SERVICE_PORT` and 
`APB_DB_PASSWORD` environment variables are injected into the Catalog pod by the secret that is 
created during the provisioning of the **Digital Ocean MySQL APB**. 

You should redeploy the Catalog service so that it uses the new configmap content as configuration. In the left 
sidebar, click on **Applications** > **Deployments** > **catalog** and then click on the **Deploy** button.

Now you have connected your application with external database running in DigtalOcean.
